Callbacks in JavaScript can be categorized based on their use cases and how they are handled in the code. Here are some different types of callbacks:

# 1. Synchronous Callbacks
Synchronous callbacks are executed immediately within the function they are passed to. They are called and executed before the parent function completes its execution.

Example
```javascript
function doSynchronousTask(callback) {
  console.log("Task started");
  callback();
  console.log("Task completed");
}

doSynchronousTask(() => {
  console.log("Callback executed");
});
```
Output:
``` text
Task started
Callback executed
Task complete
```

# 2. Asynchronous Callbacks
Asynchronous callbacks are executed after the parent function has returned. They are commonly used with functions that perform I/O operations, timers, or any operation that is expected to take some time.

Example
```javascript
function doAsynchronousTask(callback) {
  console.log("Task started");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Callback executed");
    callback();
  }, 1000);
  console.log("Task completed");
}

doAsynchronousTask(() => {
  console.log("Asynchronous operation completed");
});
```

Output:
``` text
Task started
Task completed
Callback executed
Asynchronous operation completed
```

# 3. Error-First Callbacks
Error-first callbacks are a convention in Node.js where the first argument of the callback is reserved for an error object, and the subsequent arguments are for successful results. This pattern helps in handling errors effectively in asynchronous code.

Example
```javascript
function doTask(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const error = Math.random() > 0.5 ? new Error("Something went wrong") : null;
    const result = "Task result";
    callback(error, result);
  }, 1000);
}

doTask((error, result) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  } else {
    console.log("Success:", result);
  }
});
```
Possible Output 1:
``` text
Error: Something went wrong
```
Possible Output 2:
``` text
Success: Task result
```
# 4. Callback Functions with Parameters
Callbacks can accept parameters, allowing you to pass data to the callback function.

Example
```javascript
function doTask(data, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const result = `Processed ${data}`;
    callback(result);
  }, 1000);
}

doTask("inputData", (result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```
Output:
``` text
Processed inputData
```

# 5. Inline Callbacks
Inline callbacks are anonymous functions passed directly as arguments to other functions.

Example
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inline callback executed");
}, 1000);
```
Output:
``` text
Inline callback executed
```

# 6. Named Callbacks
Named callbacks are predefined functions passed as arguments to other functions.

Example
```javascript
function callbackFunction() {
  console.log("Named callback executed");
}

setTimeout(callbackFunction, 1000);
```
Output:
``` text
Named callback executed
```

# 7. Multiple Callbacks
Some functions accept multiple callbacks to handle different scenarios, such as success and failure.

Example
```javascript
function doTask(successCallback, errorCallback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const success = Math.random() > 0.5;
    if (success) {
      successCallback("Task succeeded");
    } else {
      errorCallback("Task failed");
    }
  }, 1000);
}

doTask(
  (message) => {
    console.log("Success:", message);
  },
  (error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
);
```
Possible Output 1:
``` text
Success: Task succeeded
```

Possible Output 2:
``` text
Error: Task failed
```

# Summary

1. Synchronous Callbacks: Executed immediately within the parent function.
2. Asynchronous Callbacks: Executed after the parent function returns.
3. Error-First Callbacks: Handle errors and results, commonly used in Node.js.
4. Callbacks with Parameters: Accept data and pass it to the callback.
5. Inline Callbacks: Anonymous functions passed directly as arguments.
6. Named Callbacks: Predefined functions passed as arguments.
7. Multiple Callbacks: Functions that accept multiple callbacks for different scenarios.
```
Callbacks are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that enable powerful asynchronous programming patterns, making code more flexible and modular.
